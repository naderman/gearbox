Building
--------

The examples can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the example's source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed GearBox into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir gbxsmartbatteryacfr_example
$ cd gbxsmartbatteryacfr_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/gearbox/gbxsmartbatteryacfr
