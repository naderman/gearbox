@page gbx_doc_installdebian Installing GearBox on Debian Linux

@note Reviewed for release 0.0.1

These are detailed instructions for installing GearBox on Debian Linux. They are known to work for a system using Debian \b Testing distribution. See @ref gbx_doc_getting for general guidelines.

@section gbx_doc_installdebian_ubuntu Ubuntu\Kubuntu

These instructions should also be applicable to Ubuntu/Kubuntu 6.10 (Edgy).

@section gbx_doc_installdebian_buildessential Build Essential

@verbatim
# apt-get install build-essential
@endverbatim

@section gbx_doc_installdebian_cmake CMake

Minimum version required 2.4-patch 2 (latest tested: 2.4-patch 7).

@verbatim
# apt-get install cmake
@endverbatim

@section gbx_doc_installdebian_gearbox GearBox

@par Basic

Build and install GearBox distribution.

- Download @ref gbx_doc_getting_download "GearBox source" archive and un-tar it.
@verbatim
$ tar -zxf gearbox-x.x.x.tar.gz
$ cd gearbox
@endverbatim
- Configure (note the dot after cmake). The default installation directory is  @c /usr/local. (See below on how to customize it).
@verbatim
$ cmake .
@endverbatim
- Compile, and install.
@verbatim
$ make
# make install
# ldconfig
@endverbatim

The resultant installation tree is as follows:
@verbatim
[INSTALL-DIR]
    include
        gearbox
            mylib
                mylib.h
            yourlib
                yourlib.h
    lib
        gearbox
            libmylib.so
            libyourlib.so
@endverbatim

@par Installation Directory

The default installation directory is @c /usr/local. There are two options for specifying a custom install directory:
- Option 1. With @c cmake. This variable is stored in CMake cache so you don't have to set this variable every time: only the first time you run cmake and when you want to change it.
@verbatim
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/gearbox .
@endverbatim
or
@verbatim
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/gearbox-[VERSION] .
@endverbatim
- Option 2. If you've changed your mind about the installation directory, you can change it at any time using @c ccmake tool.
@verbatim
$ ccmake .
@endverbatim
Scroll down to  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable, hit ENTER to edit and type in the new installation directory. When finished, hit ENTER again, then type "c" for [c]onfigure and "g" for [g]enerate. From now on, the new installation dir will be used.

That's it! We are done.
