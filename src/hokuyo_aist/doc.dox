@brief Hokuyo URG laser scanner driver.

This library provides a driver for Hokuyo laser scanner devices using the SCIP protocol version 1 or
2. It has been tested with the Hokuyo URG-04LX, UBG-04LX, UHG-08LX and UTM-30LX but it should work
with any scanner that conforms to these protocol versions, including the URG-04LX-F01,
the URG-04LX-UG01 (Simple-URG), and the UXM-30LX (Tough-URG).

For a full list of classes and functions, see @ref hokuyo_aist.

If this library is compiled as static on Windows, you must define the @c HOKUYO_AIST_STATIC
preprocessor variable when compiling code that includes hokuyo_aist.h.

Header file:
@verbatim
#include <hokuyo_aist/hokuyo_aist.h>
@endverbatim

@par Example
  See test/example.cpp

@par Style guidelines

- Naming conventions:
  - Class methods start with a capital letter.
